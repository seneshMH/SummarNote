Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software developed and studied by humans or animals. It is widely used in industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, generative and creative tools, and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games. AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and has evolved into various sub-fields of AI research. Traditional goals include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. AI researchers have adapted and integrated problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics, and draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and many other fields.
